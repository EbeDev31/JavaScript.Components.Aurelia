# Hierarchy Repeat

Some components require more than repeating over a flat list and data binding
to a recursive hierarchical structure is not supported out of the box in
Aurelia in a way that makes it easy to define and reuse a view template.
This is where the `hierarchy-repeat` construct will help in dealing with the
complexity of recursive repeating the same template on all levels.
