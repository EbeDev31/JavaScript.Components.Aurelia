Aurelia Components represents common reusable components that is geared towards
optimizing the building of typical line of business applications. The components
are inspired by the API surface of [Microsoft UWP Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/).
We try to adhere to this as much as possible with exceptions for those cases where
we have other ideas, need new features, need less features or in when we can
make the API nicer, due to the nature of HTML+CSS+JavaScript.

At the core of all components, sits [Dolittle Styles]({{ < relref /interaction/styles >}}), which is built from the ground
up for effective and flexible CSS. This style system is built on top of
[Microsofts Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/).
